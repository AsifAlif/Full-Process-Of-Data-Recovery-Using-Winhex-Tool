<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
First you have to download the winhex tool. To download the tool you can use this 
website: https://www.techspot.com/downloads/579-winhex.html

I will show you with the I drive.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture1.PNG">
</p>

Form This picture you can see On my I drive I have some pictures some txt file and some other documents.

I will now delete them permanently and make The I drive full empty.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture17.PNG">
</p>

Here you can see here the Drive is now full empty.

I will now use the Winhex tool to Recover all the deleted Documents of that Drive.

First open the winhex tool. First you have to create a Disk image.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture3.PNG">
</p>

Now you have to select The drive that you want to restore. For this case the drive 
is I.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture4.PNG">
</p>

Now click ok.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture5.PNG">
</p>

After that select the image format as winhex and select the path where you want to 
recover the data. I will choose the G drive documents folder and select scope 
sectors starting as 0 as it shown in the above picture.

Now click ok..it will take a few minutes to create that image. Then you have to 
close it and to investigate you have to reopen the tool and you can see this:
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture6.PNG">
</p>

We can see all the deleted documents here. Suppose I want to recover the File1.txt 
file I have to click it and click recover/copy.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture7.PNG">
</p>

Now there will be a option of where to save the recovered data.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture8.PNG">
</p>

Here I select G drive document folder.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture9.PNG">
</p>

We have to select every deleted documents and recover them. We choose the 
destination of those recover data to G drive documents Folder. Now it’s time to test 
it.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture10.PNG">
</p>

And Boom. The deleted documents recovered successfully.

Now to Recover the deleted data from C drive:
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture11.PNG">
</p>

You have to select tools then you have to select the Open tools option.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture12.PNG">
</p>

Then you have to select HD0 under Physical storage Devices like the picture in 
below.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture13.PNG">
</p>

Then we have to take new volume snapshot.
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture14.PNG">
</p>

This snapshot is taken to ensure the image file of your system is up to date . 

Then you have to select the c drive For me it’s partition 2: C

Then you have to take the screendhot again with Tools> Disk Tools> Take a new 
snapshot.

It shows the difference between the two snapshot. If it does not show any pop up 
then there is no difference. 

Then it comes the file recovery process. For this you have to select Tools> Disk 
Tools> File Recovery by Type:
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture15.PNG">
</p>

Then this will come up:
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/AsifAlif/Full-Process-Of-Data-Recovery-Using-Winhex-Tool/blob/main/Project%20Screenshot/Capture16.PNG">
</p>

From here you have to select what kind of deleted file you want to recover.
If you want to recover .docx file you have to select that and after that You have to set the 
default size 1 and max size 20 then

You have to select the output folder where you want the recovered file saved and 
then you have to select look for everywhere then

Select Search at cluster boundaries, if possible and then select ok.

This will take a long time. 

Because it will bring back all the docx file that was 
deleted . After it finished you have to look the output destination that you have 
selected and

Boom…you will get the recovered data.

Suppose you remember what file you deleted and you also remember where that 
file was before deletion.

You can then recover that file by this.

In your c drive from me it’s partition 2: C. you have to find the destination folder 
of that file and after that you select it and you can see a option recover/copy then 
you have to set the destination where the recovered file took place.

After that go to that destination and Boom..you can see that file.
